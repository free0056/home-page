				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a Graphic Design student, working in the Ottawa area. Although I am studying right now at Algonquin College were the majority of my work takes place, I also enjoy any kind of freelance work I can get. I am in the process of building my network and getting my name out there as someone with a decent background and knowledge in many areas of design. From the moment I picked up my first colouring book I found a passion of mine that has lasted a life time. I didn't decide at first to follow it as a career path right away and dabbled in different things, but always had that hobby or need to draw and doodle. Finally, after discovering the graphic Design program at Algonquin, and doing some research, I put a portfolio together and submitted it with about a week to spare, and was accepted! I have learned a lot and am still learning, and realizing how much there is to know and how much I don't know yet about the design world. I hope to absorb as much as I can during my time at Algonquin and come out ready to do great things, until then I will just keep doing what I love! </p>
